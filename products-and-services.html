                    <p class="base-description">Wood Pellets are a type wood fuel that is commonly made from sawdust and other wood waste materials but sometimes also from sources such as whole-tree or tree tops and branches. Pellets are manufactured in several types and grades as fuel for biomass power plants. Wood pellets usually contain no added chemicals as wood naturally contains a substance called lignin that binds wood pellets in their compressed, uniform shape. The regular geometry and small size allow for precisely regulated fuel feed into the boiler using either an auger (screw) or pneumatic conveying (using air to transport the pellets). Wood pellets have a consistent high energy, low moisture content (< 10%) and very low ash content allowing a very high combustion efficiency and low air emissions. Their high density permits compact storage and economic transport over long distances. They are either supplied in big bags or can be blown into a storage area on a customer’s premises from a truck or dedicated tanker. As a biomass fuel, wood pellets offer the advantages of sustainable energy supply through renewable raw materials. Pellets are environmentally friendly with a low carbon footprint even after transportation. Similar to the wood chips, we use fast growing bamboo from dedicated plantations for production of wood pellets; however we are testing various other energy crops as well in order to create bio diversification and to adjust to local conditions.</p>
